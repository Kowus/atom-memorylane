# memorylane
> An atom plugin that gives you a mini journal of your code

Some people love the occasional trip down memory lane to visit old projects and wonder WTF was I doing when I built this. (_guilty!_)

I created this simple plugin to automatically give a comment of when I created the file and a date and time stamp. In the future, I want to be able to get weather and current playing song(_if any_) from your computer.
